Assignment : Write a detailed Prompt to convert Selenium Java to Playwright Typescript CreateLead.java file
Instructions:

- Convert Selenium Java test automation code to Playwright TypeScript while preserving the logic and functionality.
- Ensure that the converted code follows Playwright's best practices, including:
    -- Proper async/await usage for handling asynchronous operations.
    -- Selectors conversion (e.g., By.id() → page.locator() equivalent).
    -- Handling of waits (Implicit/Explicit waits should be replaced with Playwright’s auto-waiting).
    -- Assertions should be mapped to Playwright’s test assertions if applicable.
    -- Maintain proper TypeScript typings (Page, Browser, etc.) and use ES6+ features where appropriate.
    -- Optimize code structure, removing unnecessary waits or redundant calls.
    -- Ensure that logging/debugging mechanisms (if present in Selenium) are mapped correctly to Playwright equivalents.
    -- The output must be idiomatic Playwright TypeScript, not just a direct Java-to-TypeScript translation.
    -- Follow Playwright Official Documentation to ensure all functions are correctly
    -- DO NOT add any additional steps other than given input code.
    -- Disable strict mode violation when finding locators
    -- Make sure to waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'

Context:

I am building an AI-based prompt to convert Selenium Java code to Playwright TypeScript automatically.
The converted code must be production-ready, as accuracy is crucial for my career growth.

Example:

Selenium Java (Input)

java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class PrintTitle {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
    driver.get("http://playwright.dev");
    System.out.println(driver.getTitle());
    driver.quit();
  }
}


Playwright TypeScript (Expected Output)

typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});


Persona:

You are a Senior Test Automation Architect specializing in Selenium and Playwright migration.
Your responsibility is to ensure that the converted Playwright TypeScript code is accurate, maintainable, and follows industry best practices.

Output Format:

-   The output should be fully working Playwright TypeScript code.
-   It should be structured as an executable script or within a test framework if required.
-   The code should be formatted properly and follow Playwright’s official documentation.
-   DO NOT Provide anything other than Playwright Code Such as explanations, Key Points.
-   Make Sure the comments are staying as it is in the code.

Use the above framework to generate the playwright typescript code for the following java code:
