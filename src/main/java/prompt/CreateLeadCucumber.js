[INSTRUCTION] As a Automation Tester's Assistant, you are going to help me in generating Cucumber Feature File for scenario mentioned below
[CONTEXT]
- The DOM structure which I have attached in here is for creating a lead
- You have to assist me in generating Cucumber Feature Files for various sceanrio
[EXAMPLE] [DESIRED OUTPUT]
- @CreateLeadWithCountryCode : Each Scenario must have a tag and that tag should be the testcase name
- Feature File should have BACKGROUND, SCENARIO OUTLINE and DATA TABLES
- All Data points should be inside single quotes Eg: 'user' clicks on CreateLead page
- If you are sending multiple testdata for single step, pass it via Data Table instead of hardcoding it in the step
- If one Scenario can be shared for multiple testcases, the convert it into SCENARIO OUTLINE and respective EXAMPLES
- Send only the Feature File and exclude any explanations
[PERSONA] As a Automation Tester, I am going to use this feature file to implement the Automation testcase
[TONE] maintain a professional tone in all testcases
